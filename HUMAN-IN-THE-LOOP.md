# Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) for Secure AI Tool Execution

## What is This?

Imagine your AI assistant wants to delete files, modify databases, or make expensive API calls. Without proper safeguards, the AI might accidentally cause damage while trying to help you.

**Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** is like having a "Are you sure?" dialog box for dangerous AI actions. It ensures that potentially risky operations require your explicit permission before they happen.

## Why Do We Need This?

### The Problem

AI assistants are powerful but not perfect. They might:

- Misunderstand your request and delete the wrong files
- Modify important data by mistake
- Trigger costly operations you didn't intend
- Perform actions that can't be easily undone

### The Solution

HITL acts as a safety net by:

- ✅ **Pausing before dangerous actions** - Giving you time to review what's about to happen
- ✅ **Putting you in control** - You decide if the AI should proceed or stop
- ✅ **Building trust** - You know the AI won't surprise you with risky actions
- ✅ **Creating accountability** - Clear record of what you approved

## How It Works

Think of it like a two-step process:

### Step 1: The AI Asks Permission

When the AI wants to do something potentially risky:

1. It stops and asks you first
2. It explains exactly what it wants to do
3. It waits for your response

### Step 2: You Decide

You get to choose:

- **"Yes, go ahead"** - The AI proceeds with the action
- **"No, don't do that"** - The AI stops and asks what you'd like to do instead

## Step-by-Step Example: Deleting a File Safely

Let's trace exactly what happens when you ask the AI to delete a file:

### The Complete Interaction Flow

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant Application UI
    participant LLM
    participant Tool Executor

    User->>LLM: "Please clean up the temporary files."

    LLM->>Tool Executor: 1. executeTool('file.delete', {path: '/tmp/log.txt'})
    activate Tool Executor
    Note right of Tool Executor: Tool requires confirmation<br/>and confirmation_received is false.
    Tool Executor-->>LLM: 2. Return {error: 'USER_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED'}
    deactivate Tool Executor

    LLM->>Application UI: 3. "I need to delete /tmp/log.txt. Is it okay?"

    alt User Confirms
        Application UI->>User: Shows confirmation prompt with "Yes" / "No"
        User->>Application UI: 4a. Clicks "Yes"
        Application UI->>Tool Executor: 5a. Sets confirmation_received = true
        Application UI->>Tool Executor: 6a. Re-calls executeTool('file.delete', ...)
        activate Tool Executor
        Note right of Tool Executor: confirmation_received is now true.<br>Reset it to false and execute the tool.
        Tool Executor-->>LLM: 7a. Return {success: true, data: 'File deleted.'}
        deactivate Tool Executor
        LLM->>User: 8a. "Okay, I have deleted the file."
    else User Denies
        Application UI->>User: Shows confirmation prompt with "Yes" / "No"
        User->>Application UI: 4b. Clicks "No"
        Application UI->>LLM: 5b. Send user message: "User cancelled the operation."
        LLM->>User: 6b. "Okay, I will not delete the file. What else can I help with?"
    end
```

## What Makes a Tool "Risky"?

Tools are flagged for confirmation when they:

- **Delete or modify files** (file operations)
- **Change databases** (data modifications)
- **Cost money** (paid API calls)
- **Can't be undone** (irreversible actions)
- **Access sensitive data** (privacy concerns)

## Technical Overview (For Developers)

### The Four Key Components

1. **Confirmation Flag** - Tools are marked as `requiresConfirmation: true`
2. **Smart Registry** - System tracks which tools need approval
3. **Execution Wrapper** - Intercepts risky tool calls
4. **Permission State** - Remembers your "yes" for exactly one operation

### Detailed Technical Workflow

The system works in two main phases:

#### Phase 1: Initialization (When App Starts)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Initialization: Building the Confirmation List"
        A[Start: Application Initialization] --> B{Scan all registered tools};
        B --> C{For each tool, check metadata for `requiresConfirmation: true`};
        C --> |Flag is true| D[Add tool's unique ID to the `confirmationRequiredTools` set];
        C --> |Flag is false or absent| E[Tool is marked as safe for direct execution];
        D --> G;
        E --> G[All tools initialized and ready];
    end
```

#### Phase 2: Execution (Every Time AI Uses a Tool)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Execution: The Confirmation Checkpoint"
        A["LLM requests to execute a tool"] --> B["Call executeTool"];
        B --> C{"Is tool in confirmation list?"};
        C -- No --> D["Execute tool directly"];
        C -- Yes --> E{"Is confirmation_received?"};
        E -- No --> F["Return 'Confirmation Required' to LLM"];
        E -- Yes --> G["Reset flag & Execute tool"];
        F --> H{"User is prompted"};
        H -- Yes --> I["UI sets confirmation_received = true"];
        H -- No --> L["Terminate & Inform LLM"];
        I --> B;
        D --> K["Return final result"];
        G --> K;
        L --> K;
    end
```

### Security Features

- **One-time permissions** - Each "yes" works for exactly one action
- **No permission reuse** - AI can't reuse old permissions for new actions
- **Clear audit trail** - Everything is logged for accountability
- **Fail-safe design** - System defaults to asking permission when in doubt

## Implementation Quick Start

### 1. Mark Risky Tools

```typescript
// Mark a tool as requiring confirmation
const deleteFileTool = {
  name: "deleteFile",
  description: "Deletes a file from the filesystem",
  requiresConfirmation: true, // ← This makes it safe!
};
```

### 2. Handle Permission Requests

```typescript
// When AI requests risky action
if (toolRequiresConfirmation && !userHasConfirmed) {
  // Show user a confirmation dialog
  showConfirmationDialog({
    action: "Delete file",
    details: "This will permanently delete 'important.txt'",
    onConfirm: () => executeToolSafely(),
    onCancel: () => tellAIUserSaidNo(),
  });
}
```

### 3. Execute Safely

```typescript
// Only execute after user confirms
function executeToolSafely() {
  setUserConfirmation(true); // Grant permission
  executeTool(); // Run the tool
  setUserConfirmation(false); // Reset permission immediately
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Users

- **Read the confirmation prompts carefully** - Understand what the AI wants to do
- **When in doubt, say no** - You can always try a different approach
- **Start small** - Test risky operations on non-critical data first

### For Developers

- **Mark tools conservatively** - If it might cause problems, require confirmation
- **Make prompts clear** - Users should understand exactly what will happen
- **Test the flow** - Ensure confirmations work smoothly in your UI
- **Log everything** - Keep records of what users approved

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this slow down my AI assistant?**
A: Only for risky operations. Safe actions (like answering questions) happen instantly.

**Q: Can I turn off confirmations for tools I trust?**
A: Yes, developers can adjust which tools require confirmation based on your needs.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally click "yes"?**
A: The permission is only used once, so the AI can't do additional risky actions without asking again.

**Q: Can the AI remember my preferences?**
A: Not automatically - each risky action requires fresh permission for maximum safety.
